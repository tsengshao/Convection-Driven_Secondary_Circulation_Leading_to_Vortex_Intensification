# Instruction

Code to reproduce figures from the paper  
*"The Dependence Moist Vortex Intensification on Convection-Induced Moisture Distribution and Low-level Inflow: Insights for Tropical Cyclone Seed Genesis"*

This project include Python scripts (`*.py`) and GrADS scripts (`*.gs`).
Parts of the code rely on functions from my other repo: [grads-library](https://github.com/kuantingkuo/grads-library).

## Data

Data can be downloaded from Zenodo:  

## Setup

- Update `DATA_ROOT` in the scripts to point to your local data folder.  
- Set the environment variable `GASCRP` to your local `grads-library` path.

## Usage
